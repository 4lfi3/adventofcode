either number can be removed. if it's the current number, ascendingSet needs to go back to False

check():
	if unsafe level:
		if original report:
			check()

if the original report hits an unsafe level, create the 2 removal attempt reports (outside of a function, in the for loop) and run each of those. check() should return a "safe" boolean
